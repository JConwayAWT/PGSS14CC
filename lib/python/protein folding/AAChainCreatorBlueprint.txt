- First generate cartesian plane
- Convert string -> list of individual characters
- Place first element on (0,0) 
- Define coordinates as 'elements' into the grid (2N x 2N elements) (three states = 0, A, B)
- (x +/- 1, y) or (x, y+/-1) and then 'check' it to see if it's empty 
	* if empty, place amino acid and change state to A or B
	* if filled, revert and try again
	* once finished, move onto next list of individual characters

class Grid
generated grid

Methods:
searchforEmpty()
- randomly choose one of four available paths (up, down, right, left) 
- return the coordinate of the chosen path

check empty
- checks if the coordinate of the chosen path is 'empty'
- if empty, uses place
- else, goes back to searchforEmpty on old location

place
- create new amino acid with : letter, chain #, and the current coordinate (which was decided on by searchforEmpty and checkEmpty 

drawLine
- connect placed amino acids based on chain # order

class Amino Acid
- Letter
- Chain #
- Location 

Methods:
delete
- delete amino acid object 

class Coordinate 
- x coordinate
- y coordinate
